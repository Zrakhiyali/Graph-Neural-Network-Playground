# Graph-Neural-Network-Playground
This project provides an introduction to graph neural networks and utilizes models such as GCN (Graph Convolutional Network), GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network), and GAT (Graph Attention Network). These models are used for the detection and classification of graph data.

In this project, a graph with a specified number of nodes and edges is created. Then, node features and edge weights are added to it. Training, evaluation, and test data are also determined using different masks for nodes.

Subsequently, GCN, GIN, and GAT models are trained using this graph and its features. Techniques such as Dropout are employed to prevent overfitting in the models. Additionally, strategies like Learning Rate Scheduling and Early Stopping are utilized for optimizing training and preventing overfitting.
