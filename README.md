Subsequently, GCN, GIN, and GAT models are trained using this graph and its features. Techniques such as Dropout are employed to prevent overfitting in the models. Additionally, strategies like Learning Rate Scheduling and Early Stopping are utilized for optimizing training and preventing overfitting
